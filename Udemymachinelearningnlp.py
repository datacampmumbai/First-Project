# nltk - "natural language toolkit" is a python library with support for 
#         natural language processing. Super-handy.
# Specifically, we will use 2 functions from nltk
#  sent_tokenize: given a group of text, tokenize (split) it into sentences
#  word_tokenize: given a group of text, tokenize (split) it into words
#  stopwords.words('english') to find and ignored very common words ('I', 'the',...) 
#  to use stopwords, you need to have run nltk.download() first - one-off setup

# We have use dictionaries so far, but now that we have covered classes - this is a good
# time to introduce defaultdict. THis is class that inherits from dictionary, but has
# one additional nice feature: Usually, a Python dictionary throws a KeyError if you try 
# to get an item with a key that is not currently in the dictionary. 
# The defaultdict in contrast will simply create any items that you try to access 
# (provided of course they do not exist yet). To create such a "default" item, it relies 
# a function that is passed in..more below.

    # indentation changes - we are out of the constructor (member function, but we are still inside)
    # the class.
    # One important note: if you are used to programming in Java or C#: if you define a variable here
    # i.e. outside a member function but inside the class - it becomes a STATIC member variable

        # we want to return the first n sentences with highest ranking, use the nlargest function to do so
